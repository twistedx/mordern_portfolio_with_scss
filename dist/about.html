              <p>Ive never been a star Quarter back or a guide in a bootcamp , but i have always done whatever it takes to succeed in the things i do. Along with teaching me hard work and dedication the Marine Core imparted on me leadership qualities that allow me to step into a mirad of situations , and see projects to their full potential. A lifetime of experience in many fields using both technical and analytical skills has brought me  to the path i am on today. I relish a challenge, and am continually on a pursuit to gain industry knowledge and enhance my skills. That is why i am very much looking forward to what the future holds for me , as a software engineer.</p>
