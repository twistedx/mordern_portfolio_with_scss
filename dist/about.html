              <p>I was never a star quarterback, or guide in bootcamp (Honor Graduate).  But one thing I am, is successful in everything that I do.  Why is that?  Because I am a "Do'er", I do what it takes to get the job done.  If I commit to a project or a team I do what it takes to see the project through.  Even spending long hours learning new technologies.  I will do what it takes to succeed. I have a life time of expierence in many fields with many technical skills.  That coupled with my leadership abilities taught me from being a United States Marine means I can step into any situation and see to it that we are successful. I look forward to what the future brings as a Software Engineer.</p>
