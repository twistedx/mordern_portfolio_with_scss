# mordern_portfolio_with_scss

Here is the repository with the SCSS files that were used to make the Modern Portfolio. It was a lot of work but it made an awesome product. I followed along the tutorial from Travery Media and then added my own flair to the project, like the modal popup on the pictures as well as the pulsing menu around the button. I learned a ton about SCSS with this project!
